Write a program to identify vehicle door status as pr below requirements.
Rq1:vehicle "Leco" has 5 doors.
Rq2:Door status is open if the respective variable bit is set to 1
Rq3:Door status is close if the respective variable bit is set to 0
Rq4:Variable v_Driver_side_doors contain 2 doors status of driver side in bit position 6,7
Rq5:Variable v_Passenger_side_doors contain 2 doors status of passenger side in bit position 3,4
Rq6:Variable v_tail_doors_constrain doors status of tail door status 0
Identify each door status of the vehicle "Leco" if variable values are as below and print ach doors status whether it is open or closed
v_Driver_side_doors=0xA5;
v_passenger_side_doors=0x55;
v_tail_doors_constrain=0xAA;

    tail_doors=v_tail_doors_constrain&(0x01);//extracting 0th bit of tail door
