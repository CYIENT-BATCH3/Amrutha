Algorithm 

step1:Read variable v_driverside_door value,v_passengerside_door,v_tail_door

step2:for driverside first door, read bit position 6
step2.1:If 6th bit is 0, door is close
step2.2:If 6th bit is 1, door is open

step3:for driverside second door, read bit position 7
step3.1:If 7th bit is 0, door is close
step3.2:If 7th bit is 1, door is open

step4:for passengerside first door, read bit position 3
step4.1:If 3rd bit is 0, door is close
step4.2:If 3rd bit is 1, door is open

step5:for passengerside second door, read bit position 3
step5.1:If 4th bit is 0, door is close
step5.2:If 4th bit is 1, door is open

step6:for tail door constraint read bit position 0
step6.1:if 0th bit is 0, door is open
step6.2:if 0th bit is 1, door is close
