write a program using while loop to print even numbers from 1 to n
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    //declare the variables
   int num,i=1;
    
//taking input from user i.e range of  evennumbers to print
    printf("enter the range");
    scanf("%d",&num);

   while(i<=num)//setting the condition to print even numbers to the entered value 
   {
      if(i%2==0) //check the number is divisible by 2 and if yes print the number
      {
          printf("%d\n",i);
      }
     i++;  
   }
   
return 0;
}
